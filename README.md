## 👋 I’m Sergey - Digital Art Director · AI-Driven Design & Prototyping

I’m a digital art director and product designer building visual systems and tools at the intersection of **design, generative AI, and rapid prototyping**. 

My core strength is turning an idea or reference into a **repeatable production pipeline** - from concept and style guides to prototypes, content systems, and automation.

---

## What I do
- **Art Direction & Visual Systems**: creative concepts, visual languages, design systems, guidelines, key visuals.
- **Generative AI in Production**: prompt engineering and pipelines for stills/motion, style control, consistency, and variation at scale.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: fast MVPs (often in **React**) to validate hypotheses, UX flows, and mechanics.
- **Automation & Knowledge Systems**: building processes around content and production (Notion/ClickUp/Airtable/integrations) so speed doesn’t kill quality.
- **Creative R&D**: exploring visual patterns and experimental digital forms.

## Tooling
**GenAI:** Midjourney · Sora · ChatGPT · Claude · Cursor · Krea · ComfyUI  
**Design:** Figma (including AI workflows) · design systems · brand guidelines · digital guidelines  
**Prototyping:** React · fast web MVPs · component-driven UI  
**Ops/Automation:** Notion/ClickUp/Airtable · integrations · content pipelines

---

## How I can help
- Package a brand or product into a **clear visual language** with repeatable rules.
- Build a **generative pipeline** that delivers predictable quality (not random luck).
- Ship a **prototype fast** to validate ideas without months of development.
- Turn content and task chaos into a **system** (templates, presets, automation, QA criteria).

---

## Now
Current focus: **AI tools for content production + product prototypes**.
